- [Setup](#setup)
- [Running the App](#running-in-development-mode)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Setup <a id="setup"></a>

Clone this project to your desktop or appropriate folder by cd-ing into that directory and running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Logistics21/Weather-App.git
```

Then, cd into the Weather-App directory and run the following command inside your app’s directory:

```sh
npm install
```

This builds the `node-modules` library required to run this app.

### Running the App <a id="running-in-development-mode"></a>

Then, run the following command inside your app’s directory:

```sh
npm start
```

This will deploy the app in development mode at the localhost port #3000. *Make sure you are not currently running any other apps at that port*
